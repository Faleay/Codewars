DESCRIPTION:
We need to sum big numbers and we require your help.

Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers. The input numbers are strings and the function must return a string.

Example
add("123", "321"); -> "444"
add("11", "99");   -> "110"
Notes
The input numbers are big.
The input is a string of only digits
The numbers are positives

P.S. My solutons looks not too good because at that time I did not know about the existence of a library for solving this problem...
So I wrote the solution as best I could using my little knowledge of the language.
Maybe the fact that I can solve such a complex problem somehow does me more honor than the knowledge of some library... Oh, these excuses for myself :3
